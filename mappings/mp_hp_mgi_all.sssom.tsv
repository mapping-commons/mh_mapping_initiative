#mapping_set_title: All mappings of MP terms to HPO terms generated by MGI
#mapping_set_description: "Consolidated list of all HPO to MP mappings done by MGI. In the comments section the project that was the source of the list is listed. Some terms came from more than one source. The KidsFirst list was a list of HPO terms provided by the KidsFirst team from the set of terms used for patients in their cohorts. The scoliosis, Alzheimer, cleft palate, Down Syndrome, CHARGE Syndrome, Cornelia De Lange Syndrome, and COVID term sets were generated by MGI for symptoms or phenotypes associated with the disease. For the COVID set the references for each sign or symptom are listed in the Other column. Initially the mapping dates for the KidsFirst mappings were not tracked, so these were given the date of when we received the file (5/27/21).  The scoliosis, cleft palate, Down Syndrome, CHARGE Syndrome, and Cornelia De Lange Syndrome sets consist of MP terms that are associated with mouse models of scoliosis. For Down Syndrome, CHARGE Syndrome, and Cornelia De Lange Syndrome HPO terms associated with each disease were also pulled from the HPO files for mapping. The Alzheimer and COVID sets were created by identifying symptoms and signs for patients from the literature then identifying the relevant MP and HP terms and finally mapping the identified terms to terms in the other ontology. Use of skos mappings terms: exact match: MP term is the same as the HPO term, ignoring that the HP term applies only to humans; broad match: HPO term covers more than the MP term, ignoring the species restriction; narrow match: HPO term is more restricted than the MP term; related match: MP term and HPO term share some similarity but would not have a parent-child relation in a shared ontology."

HP:0000081	Duplicated collecting system	skos:narrowMatch	0.6	MP:0011803	double kidney pelvis	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	orcid:0000-0003-4606-0597	2021-09-30	KidsFirst; The MP does not have a term for renal collecting system but looking at the HPO definition of duplicated collecting system, in particulatr kidney with two (instead of, normally, one) pyelocaliceal systems. The pyelocaliceal system is comprised of the renal pelvis and calices. and the Uberon and MP organization of renal pelvis and renal calyx (calyx is part of pelvis), it seemed to me that the MP double pelvis term is as close as I could get. There may be some distinction I'm missing as the HPO has a term for Duplication of renal pelvis (HP:0005580) but it is unclear to me how this is distinct from duplicated collecting system. I'm guessing that the pelvis includes parts that are not part of the collecting system? Uberon has a term for renal collecting system (UBERON:0004100) defined as collecting duct system of the kidney consists of a series of tubules and ducts that connect the nephrons to the ureter and this has no connection to the renal pelvis and calyx. Given that the duplicated HP term specifies pelvis and calices I would have expected some connection.

The MP definition for the child term abnormal cerebrospinal fluid absorption where there is no obstruction to fluid flow in the ventricular system indicating that in this form the absorption is the issue. Based on child terms it is possibly that the hydrocephaly/hydrocephalus terms in MP and HP should be exact.

The MP term defintion includes both directions whereas the HPO term definition specifies anterior slippage due to complete bilateral fractures of the pars interarticularis.
